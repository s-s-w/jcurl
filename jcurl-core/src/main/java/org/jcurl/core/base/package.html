<p>Core datatypes and concepts.</p>
<h3>Cordinate systems</h3>
<p>JCurl uses various coordinate systems to reduce complexity. All
of them are 2 dimensional and related to each other via {@link
java.awt.geom.AffineTransform} matrices.</p>
	<h4>World Coordinates (WC)</h4>
	<p>Real world locations. (0,0) is at the tee (centerline x
	teeline) with positive Y-axis along the centerline. Right handed, unit
	of measurement is 1 meter.</p>
	<h4>Display Coordinates (DC)</h4>
	<p>(0,0) is at the top left edge of the current window on screen.
	Almost only for incoming mouse events. Left handed, unit of measurement
	is 1 pixel.</p>
	<h4>Rock Coordinates (RC)</h4>
	<p>Used to compute rock curves i.e. to implement curl models.
	(0,0) is at the rock's center of mass with positive Y-axis along the
	initial speed. Right handed, unit of measurement is 1 meter.</p>
	<h4>Collission Coordinates (CC)</h4>
	<p>Used to compute rock collissions i.e. to implement hit models.
	(0,0) is at the rock A's center of mass with positive Y-axis pointing
	towards B's center of mass. Right handed, unit of measurement is 1
	meter.</p>
