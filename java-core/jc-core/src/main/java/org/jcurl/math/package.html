<p>Generic math helpers without dependencies to other jcurl
packages. Could even be a separate binary - therefore it's package name
is not <code>org.jcurl.core.math</code></p>
<h3>Why isn't math framework X used?</h3>
<p>First of all every framework is likely to bring unneeded/unwanted
stuff but this core library should remain slim anf fast, concerning both
download and runtime. It should be useable within applets or java
webstart over slow networks. Therefore it also has to have as few
dependencies as possible.</p>

<p>Second the requirements here are rather simple. <code>R^1
-&gt; R^3</code> monotone, C1 continuous functions. That's all.</p>
<p>Third I use a dirty trick to pack up 2D and angular
position/speed into one 3D {@link org.jcurl.core.api.Rock}. This
contradicts the JSR-275 measure concept, so jscience will not like this.</p>
<p>But nevertheless the following frameworks were examined:</p>

<h4><a href="http://commons.apache.org/math/">Jakarta Commons
Math</a></h4>
<ul>
	<li>brings quite a bit unneeded stuff (jar of 331K),</li>
	<li>Exceptions on function evaluation,</li>
	<li>getting derivatives seems a bit a hassle (via the regular
	Interfaces),</li>
	<li>No interfaces for multi-dimensional functions</li>
</ul>

<h4><a href="http://www.jscience.org/">JScience</a></h4>
<ul>
	<li>brings a lot of unneeded stuff (jar of 680K),</li>
	<li>heavy Boxing/Unboxing because of generics (maybe this isn't
	critical?),</li>
	<li>evaluating a functions changes inner state and therefore isn't
	threadsafe.</li>
</ul>
<p>I admit that jscience is really tempting. I'll keep an eye on it.</p>
