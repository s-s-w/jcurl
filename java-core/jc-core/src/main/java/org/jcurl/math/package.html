<p>Generic math helpers without dependencies to other jcurl
packages. Could even be a separate binary - therefore it's package name
is not <code>org.jcurl.core.math</code></p>
<h3>Why isn't math library X used?</h3>
<p>First of all every library is likely to bring unneeded/unwanted
stuff but this core library should remain slim and fast, concerning both
download and runtime. It should be useable within applets or java
webstart over slow networks. Therefore it also has to have as few
dependencies as possible.</p>

<p>Second the requirements here are rather simple. <code>R^1
-&gt; R^3</code> monotone, C1 continuous functions. That's all.</p>
<p>Third I use a dirty trick to pack up spatial (2D) <em>and</em>
angular position <em>and</em> speed into one 3D {@link
org.jcurl.core.api.Rock}. This contradicts the JSR-275 measure concept,
so jscience will not like this.</p>
<p>But nevertheless the following libs were examined:</p>

<h4><a href="http://commons.apache.org/math/">Jakarta Commons
Math</a></h4>
<ul>
	<li>brings quite a bit unneeded stuff (jar of 331K),</li>
	<li>Exceptions on function evaluation,</li>
	<li>getting derivatives seems a bit a hassle (via the regular
	Interfaces),</li>
	<li>No interfaces for multi-dimensional functions</li>
</ul>

<h4><a href="http://www.jscience.org/">JScience</a></h4>
<ul>
	<li>brings a lot of unneeded stuff (jar of 680K),</li>
	<li>heavy Boxing/Unboxing because of generics (maybe this isn't
	critical?),</li>
	<li>evaluating a function seems to change inner state and
	therefore might not be threadsafe.</li>
	<li>type-checked measures require derivatives to be different
	classes (at least with a different type parameter)</li>
</ul>
<p>I admit that jscience is really tempting. I'll keep an eye on it.</p>
