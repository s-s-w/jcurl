During my days as an active Curler I spent quite a time thinking about
what's happening when a rock slides over the ice or hits another one.
And the longer I thought and the more people I asked the mystery did
nothing but grow.

Some situations I could predict by experience rather fair. Some more
skilled fellows could others. But some outcomes were completely
miraculous.

So I started to gather scientific material to cover the topic
from a theoretical base. Because once you got a model working properly
for known situations, you can start to examine unknown ones and compare
the model's predictions with reality. This way you get a fundamental
understanding of what's going on.

At the beginning I considered this to be a kind of brain-jogging, but now I
think the sport has developed so far yet that a team can't seriously
practice competitive curling without at least noticing some theoretical
knowledge e.g.\ about psychology but also physics.

Because to throw an \emph{impossible} matchwinner you first have to
recognise the option, then you need to dare it and surely, you need skill
\&\ luck to succeed.

This paper wants to examine the theoretical basics of running rocks and hits at
first and later apply these laws to real curling situations and get some useful
hints \&\ clues.
