The loss of energy\index{energy!loss} on hits because of friction rock/ice
to me seems to be very important.

A loss of energy could be introduced by a reduction of the remaining
path to run $(\Delta s)$ as a reduction of the transferred speed (momentum)
$ v_\parallel $ ($ a $ is friction-caused acceleration):
%
\begin{eqnarray}
v & \approx & \sqrt{ v_0^2 - 2 \cdot \Delta s \cdot a }
\end{eqnarray}
%
This relation isn't the result of proper theoretical knowledge or derived,
but bases heuristically on more or less vague experience.

Evtl.\ also of big influence might be to examine the rock's exact behaviour
during contact. Esp.\ the displacement of the rocks \emph{during} the
contact I consider to be nonneglegible.
