<p>Stream related IO / serialisation.</p>
<h3>Serialisation</h3>
<p>There are several aspects to this topic as there are different things to
store and retrieve, namely
<ul>
<li>rock setup (locations and velocities) as e.g. immediately after a player has 
released a rock.</li>
<li>trajectories - what happens after the release. These come (at least) in 2 flavours:
	<ul>
	<li>Analytic, described by curves</li>
	<li>Discrete, described by incremental rock positions</li>
	</ul></li>
<li>Event, game, end and release meta data (e.g. where, when, what, who)</li>
<li>Ice properties as e.g. friction and curl.</li>
<li>Scores</li>
</ul>
