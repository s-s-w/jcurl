For the above formulae beeing quite complex I made a C++ library with all you
need to simulate hits and running rocks. It compiles with Borland C++ 2.0, gcc
2.7.2 (sun) and djgpp 2.8.1. I also added means for quick and compact storing
of trajectories. Very simple graphics output classes also exist. I called the
package 'mrcurl' and would like to publish it, but don't know which way.

If you're interested in this lib (or the two primitive programs 'curlcomp' to
compute and 'curlview' to view) mail me. Also mail me if you'd like to help me
porting the stuff to Java.
