		Welcome to the Scene Graph project, which provides "scene graph" functionality at the Java level, as well as providing one of the important runtime elements that the JavaFX Script language depends upon from the underlying platform. This project is released in very early access form, so that people can see what we are doing and play with it as we continue developing.
