Welcome to JCurl Curling Framework

 This open source project aims to provide free tools to build {{{http://java.sun.com} java}}-based 
applications concerning the {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling}sport of curling}}.

 Possible topics are e.g.

      * Games

      * Statistics and archiving

      * Coaching, strategy and analysis tools

      * Scientific simulation of rock dynamics

 This project doesn't provide readymade applications yet but rather a framework to
easily develop such.	

 But there are {{{demoapps.html} demo applications}} to show some capabilities.
