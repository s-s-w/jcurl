In Progress

	* Design rework

	* Collission computing without spin (as a baseline for other collission models)

Next

	* Analytic collission detection

	* transformed (WC) trajectories

	* Denny curl model

	* PathIterator to display trajectories

	* Curve store

	* Sophisticated editing UI
	
	* Proper viewing UI

Postponed
	
	* Meta data (event, game, players, etc.)

	* Realistic collission model including loss of energy

Finished

	* Ice friction from Draw-to-Tee time

	* Initial speed from Split-Time (+Broom?)

	* No-curl Ice model with constant friction (as a baseline for other curl models)

	* Save game situations

	* physical collission model including rock rotation

	* Reduce download size

	* Load game situations

	* Display of a (hard-coded) rock setup

	* animation of rock movement

	* very simple physical model (ice without curl, fully 
          elastic hits neglecting rock rotation)
