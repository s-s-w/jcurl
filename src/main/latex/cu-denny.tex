\section{Denny Model}
The curl model by Mark Denny published in \cite{denny:98} uses polynomes of
fourth degree to model a decent curl.

\subsection{Equations of Motion}
\begin{eqnarray}
x(t) &=&  \\
y(t) &=&  \\
\alpha(t) &=& 
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Ice Friction from Draw-to-Tee Time}
For a draw-to-tee we have -- with distance Hog-to-Tee $Y$ and Draw-to-Tee time 
$T$ --
\begin{eqnarray}
y(T) &=& Y \\
\dot y(T) &=& 0
\end{eqnarray}
an thus

\subsection{Initial speed from split time}
Setting the coordinate origin to Center Line $\times$ Hog Line and playing
along the center line we get $v_0$ at the Hog-Line for the Split Time $t_S$ and
the distance Back-Line to Hog-Line $Y$:

\begin{eqnarray}
y(-t_S) &=& -Y \\
y(0) &=& 0 
\end{eqnarray}
