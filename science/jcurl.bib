	interactive systems that allows recovery to be defined precisely
	and user and system respon- sibilities to be delineated. Section
	3 enumerates various useful restrictions on the types of recovery
	a user can request. Section 4 describes several implementation techniques
	for supporting recovery. An application of a general recovery facility
	that provides support for reverse execution of programs is the subject

	real-time groupware systems from other multi-user systems and discusses
	their concurrency control requirements. An algorithm for concurrency
	control in real-time groupware systems is then presented. The advantages
	of this algorithm are its simplicity of use and its responsiveness:
	users can operate directly on the data without obtaining locks. The
	algorithm must know some semantics of the operations. However the
	algorithm's overall structure is independent of the semantic information,
	allowing the algorithm to be adapted to many situations. An example
	application of the algorithm to group text editing is given, along
	with a sketch of its proof of correctness in this particular case.

  abstract = {The creative process requires experimentation, the exploration of
	variations, and the continual evaluation of one's progress. While
	these processes are frequently non-linear and iterative, modern user
	interfaces do not explicitly support these practices, and instead
	impose a linear progression through tasks that is a poor fit for
	creative pursuits. In this paper we use data from three case studies,
	and draw upon Sch$#246;n's theory of reflection-in-action to illustrate
	specific deficiencies in current user interfaces when used in creative
	endeavors. We then develop a set of guidelines for user interface
	design and demonstrate their application in three designs intended
	to support tasks in the domain of image manipulation.},
