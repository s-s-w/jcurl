	the rotational speed of the contact areasof the cylinder about the
	center of mass is small compared to thetranslational speed of the
	center of mass.The principal features of the model are (i) that the
	kineticfriction induces melting of the ice, with the consequence
	that thereexists a thin film of liquid water lying between the contact
	areasof the cylinder and the ice; (ii) that the radial segmentsdrag
	some of the thin liquid film around the cylinder as it rotates,with
	the consequence that the relative velocity between the cylinderand
	the thin liquid film is significantly different than the relativevelocity
	between the cylinder and the underlying solid ice surface.Since it
	is the former relative velocity that dictates the nature of themotion
	of the cylinder, our model predicts, and observations confirm, thatsuch
	a slowly rotating cylinder stops rotating well before translationalmotion
	ceases. This is in sharp contrast to the usual case of most slowlyrotating
	cylinders, where both rotational and translational motion ceaseat
	the same instant. We have verified this prediction of our model bycareful
	comparison to the actual motion of a cylinder having a contactarea
	as described.},

	None of the existing solutions for group undo is able to support
