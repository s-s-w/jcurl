Welcome to JCurl Curling Framework

 This open source project aims to provide free tools to build {{{http://java.sun.com} java}}-based 
applications concerning the sport of curling.

 Possible topics are e.g.

      * Games

      * Statistics and archiving

      * Coaching, strategy and analysis tools

      * Scientific simulation of rock dynamics

 This project doesn't provide readymade applications yet but rather a framework to
easily develop such.	

 But there are {{{demoapps.html} demo applications}} to show some capabilities.

* Project Information

 The project is hosted by {{{http://developer.berlios.de/projects/jcurl/} Berlios }}, 
 is completely open and contribution in any form is highly appreciated.
