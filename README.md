JCurl is about physics + curling. Mostly a java library to compute collissions and curl
plus a [(Java Webstart) demo](http://www.jcurl.org/jws/org/jcurl/demo/tactics/0.7-SNAPSHOT/launch.jnlp)
to give an idea of the scope.

The project moved here from Berlios and a self-hosted MediaWiki recently, that's why
most of the [wiki pages](https://github.com/mro/jcurl/wiki/_pages) look a bit quirky.
