JCurl is about physics + curling. Mostly a (fast!) java library to compute
[collissions](http://jcurl.org/m2/site/jc-core/0.7-SNAPSHOT/apidocs/org/jcurl/core/impl/CollissionSpinLoss.html)
and
[curl](http://jcurl.org/m2/site/jc-core/0.7-SNAPSHOT/apidocs/org/jcurl/core/impl/CurlerDenny.html)
plus a
[(Java Webstart) demo](http://www.jcurl.org/jws/org/jcurl/demo/tactics/0.7-SNAPSHOT/launch.jnlp)
to give an idea of the scope.

The project moved here from
[Berlios](https://developer.berlios.de/projects/jcurl/)
and a self-hosted MediaWiki recently, that's why most of the
[wiki pages](https://github.com/mro/jcurl/wiki/_pages)
look a bit quirky.
